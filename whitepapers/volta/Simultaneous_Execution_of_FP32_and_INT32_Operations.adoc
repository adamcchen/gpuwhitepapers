= Simultaneous Execution of FP32 and INT32 Operations

Unlike Pascal GPUs, which could not execute FP32 and INT32 instructions simultaneously, the 
Volta GV100 SM includes separate FP32 and INT32 cores, allowing simultaneous execution of 
FP32 and INT32 operations at full throughput, while also increasing instruction issue throughput. 
Dependent instruction issue latency is also reduced for core FMA (Fused Multiply-Add) math 
operations, requiring only four clock cycles on Volta, compared to six cycles on Pascal.

Many applications have inner loops that perform pointer arithmetic (integer memory address 
calculations) combined with floating-point computations that will benefit from simultaneous 
execution of FP32 and INT32 instructions. Each iteration of a pipelined loop can update addresses 
(INT32 pointer arithmetic) and load data for the next iteration while simultaneously processing 
the current iteration in FP32.
